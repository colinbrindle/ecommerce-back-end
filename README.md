# E-Commerce Backend

### **Description**

This project was an exercise in creating a back-end for an e-commerce application with functioning CRUD operations. The application utilizes Express.js, MySQL, and Sequelize to facilitate interactions with the e-commerce database.

While the application is fully functional - see [video demonstration](https://youtu.be/ievi5pzNNeY) - the product related POST and PUT requests returned 400 Bad Requests and errors in the console. I will have to do further research and troubleshooting to resolve this minor issue.
